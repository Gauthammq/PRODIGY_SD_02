# Number Guessing Game

## Objective

Develop a program that generates a random number within a specified range and challenges the user to guess the number. The program provides feedback for each guess and keeps track of the number of attempts until the correct guess is made.

## Requirements

1. **Random Number Generation**: The program generates a random number within a specified range (e.g., 0 to 100).
2. **User Input**: The program prompts the user to enter their guess.
3. **Feedback Mechanism**: 
   - If the guess is too high, display a message indicating that the guess is too high.
   - If the guess is too low, display a message indicating that the guess is too low.
   - If the guess is correct, display a congratulatory message and the number of attempts taken.
4. **Iteration**: The program continues to prompt the user for guesses until the correct number is guessed.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clear and concise prompts and messages to guide the user through the game.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Immediate feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- **Efficient Looping**: Efficiently handles multiple guesses and continues until the correct number is guessed.
- **Accurate Attempt Tracking**: Correctly counts and displays the number of attempts taken by the user.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Import the necessary libraries**: Import the `random` library for number generation and `tkinter` for the GUI.
2. **Generate a random number** within the specified range.
3. **Initialize a counter** for the number of attempts.
4. **Create a loop that**:
   - Prompts the user for a guess.
   - Compares the guess to the generated number.
   - Provides feedback (too high, too low, or correct).
   - Increments the attempt counter.
5. **Exit the loop** and display the total number of attempts when the correct number is guessed.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - `random` for number generation
  - `tkinter` for the graphical user interface
